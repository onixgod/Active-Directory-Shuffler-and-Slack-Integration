# Active Directory Shuffler and Slack Integration

## Objective
The Active Directory, Shuffler and Slack Integration project aimed to create an automated incident response workflow that bridges security monitoring with real-time team communication. The primary focus was to establish seamless integration between Active Directory security events, SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) capabilities through Shuffler, and instant notification systems via Slack. This hands-on experience was designed to simulate enterprise-level security operations workflows, automate threat detection responses, and demonstrate proficiency in orchestrating multi-platform security tools essential for SOC Tier 1 analyst responsibilities.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) concepts and practical implementation.
- Proficiency in configuring and managing Active Directory security monitoring and event correlation.
- Splunk installation and configuration in educational environments.
- Splunk data ingestion from multiple sources and log formats.
- Creation and management of Splunk alert rules for automated threat detection.
- Vultr cloud environment setup and configuration for security lab deployments.
- Implementation and management of firewall rules for network segmentation and security.
- Ability to design and implement automated incident response workflows using Shuffler.
- Enhanced knowledge of API integrations between security tools and communication platforms.
- Development of skills in creating custom playbooks for threat detection and automated alerting.
- Experience with real-time notification systems and escalation procedures in SOC environments.
- Understanding of security tool integration and workflow orchestration.
- Improved ability to streamline security operations through automation and reduce manual response times.

### Tools Used
- Splunk - SIEM platform for log ingestion, analysis, and alert management
- Linux Ubuntu - Operating system platform for Splunk deployment
- Active Directory - Directory service for user authentication and security event generation
- Windows Server 2022 - Two separate servers: one dedicated for AD deployment and one as test machine
- Shuffler - SOAR platform for security orchestration and automated response workflows
- Slack - Team communication platform for real-time incident notifications
- Vultr - Cloud infrastructure provider for hosting the lab environment (3 VMs total)
- Vultr Network Firewall - Cloud-based firewall rules for secure access control
- PowerShell - For scripting and automation tasks
- APIs - For integrating different security tools and platforms
- Virtual Machines - Three VMs creating isolated testing environments

## Steps
### Step 1: Project Planning and Architecture Design
The first step in this project is to create a comprehensive diagram and playbook that will guide our deployment process. This planning phase is crucial for understanding the data flow, system interactions, and automation workflows before we begin the actual implementation.
### 1.1 Creating the Network Diagram
I will be using Draw.io (a free diagramming platform) to sketch the project architecture. This visual representation will provide clear guidance on how to approach each component of the project.
### Diagram Components:

- ### Three Virtual Machines:
    - **MyLab-ADDC01** - Active Directory Domain Controller (Windows Server 2022)
    - **MyLab-Test01** - Test/Target machine for attack simulation (Windows Server 2022)
    - **MyLab-Splunk** - SIEM platform for log collection and analysis (Ubuntu Linux)

- ### Cloud Services Integration:
    - **Shuffler - SOAR platform for automation and orchestration
    - **Slack - Communication platform for real-time notifications

- ### Network Infrastructure:
    - **Vultr Cloud - Hosting platform for all three VMs
    - **Vultr Network Firewall - Access control and security rules
    - **Attacker Machine - External laptop representing threat actor
